  <p><strong>TL;DR If you rely on our signing of RSpec releases you'll have to get a new cert from us</strong></p>

<p>For the upcoming release of RSpec 3.2 we've created a new signing certificate
for the RSpec gems. The reason for this change is that
<a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec/blob/6af4995482ade2d49ad361ee003dee29f713ab17/certs/rspec.pem">our old certificate</a>
expired. Rubygems certificates have a 1 year expiry by default. The new certificate can be found
<a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec/blob/858e0c2ac849d941bfd5b3a5c5e04a4f596fe666/certs/rspec.pem">on GitHub</a>
and has a 10 year expiry, so you can expect it to be used to verify all of the
RSpec gems for a while. The expiry of our old certificate means there...</p>

  <p>RSpec's website has been in need of a refresh for a long time. We've
been working on this new site, off and on, for more than a year, and
we're glad to finally ship it. We hope that it'll prove much
more useful to the community than the old site, particularly since it
now hosts our <a href="/documentation">documentation</a> and our <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank all the people who helped make this site happen:</p>

the site and are covering its on-going costs.</li>

  <p>RSpec 3.1 has just been released! Given our commitment to
<a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, this should be a trivial
upgrade for anyone already using RSpec 3.0, but if we did introduce
any regressions, please let us know, and we'll get a patch release
out with a fix ASAP.</p>

<p>RSpec continues to be a community-driven project with contributors
from all over the world. This release includes 647 commits from 190
pull requests from 47 different contributors.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who helped make this release happen...</p>

In his current job at GitHub, he's using Ruby and Rails much less than
he used to. It has been really great to have the chance to work with Andy
over the last few years. I can't thank him enough. His work on
rspec-rails in particular (since he's been lead maintainer) has been
awesome. We wish him well in his future endeavors.</p>

matchers. This feature supports more powerful, less brittle
expectations, and opens up new possibilities.</p>
